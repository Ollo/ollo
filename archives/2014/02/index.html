<p>So in an act of love for WordPress I signed up to be the lead organizer for WordCamp St. Louis this year. Its been a lot of work but its also really exciting to work with the local community to put on a WordCamp. This year is looking to be a really good camp as its already sold out and we have a great list of national and local speakers.</p>
<p>I attempted to give up my spot as a speaker so I could focus on organizing but ended up needing to cover a spot for a speaker that had to back out. <a href="http://2014.stlouis.wordcamp.org/session/adding-automation-to-your-theme-development-workflow/" target="_blank" rel="external">I’ll be giving a chat</a> on automating your theme development workflow with tools like YeoPress and Grunt. I’m pretty excited despite all the pressure and hope to see tons of local users benefit from the camp like I have at previous ones.</p>
<h3 id="Update"><a href="#Update" class="headerlink" title="Update"></a>Update</h3><p>So WordCamp St. Louis in my humble first time organizer opinion was a huge success and our local community really did a fantastic job. The speakers were awesome, the sponsors were super generous with swag and support, and despite the weather closing the day down a bit early I think everyone had a pretty good time, learned a lot and enjoyed themselves.</p>
<p>I thought my rushed chat came out pretty well even though I rushed a bit and forgot a few things because I was nervous. This year I decided to keep the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ollo/wordcamp-st-louis-2014" target="_blank" rel="external">slides</a> lighter and styled but use more interactive sections to demo the tools and I really enjoyed the flow much better than previous chats I’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Definitely throw in gifs and funny pictures.</p>
