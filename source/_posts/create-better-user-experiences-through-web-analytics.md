Analytics are common place in the online world but more and more I find site owners with no clue as to why they are installed and or how to find actionable  information in the reporting. This new attempted article series will provide some helpful tips for analytics users from a wide array of topics including software choices, installation, custom reporting, and how to gather insights for site-wide improvement regardless of industry.

### Purpose : why analytics are valuable

I once had a conversation with a very web savvy friend of mine who couldn't understand how analytics can be valuable to someone who isn't running an online store. My response was that **_conversion is not just in ecommerce_**, it is in all web sites this could be through a purchase, an interaction through comments, or a social feature like tweeting the page or sharing it on Facebook. So don't consider it a tool for just one purpose, analytics is just a modern highly comprehensive reporting tool to provide detailed information about the usage of your website, its not just a tool for making sales on the internet. Also if you consider analytics as a tool to better enhance how people are using your content, images, writing, etc, then really you are just focusing on making the web better by refining what you contribute to it. This is a concept that I think we all should be cognizant of regardless of what we are publishing and or creating. This concept in mind there are many options and choices with analytics so **_not all solutions are equal for all projects_** and looking through the options to find the right fit for your project is key.

### Software Choices

There are literally hundreds of choices and options for analytics software with new start-ups and concepts popping up every day. For this series I am attempting to stay high level and focus on concepts of analytics as well as basic reports that can be immediately beneficial for webmasters and site owners. To more easily accommodate a broader audience I will stick to 3 large vendors with varied specialties and options to just scratch the surface of what is available. If you have others you've tried that you would recommend please comment and share.

#### 1\. Google Analytics

Obviously the big guy will be on the list. A great free option which is fairly industry standard at this point. I daily speak with clients that didn't even know this has been added to their pages let alone how to use it. I love the broad options and resources available for this platform like apps for my android phone and plugins for common cms sites, but also am starting, like many others to be very mindful of how much data I am openly handing to the big G from my sites and personal usage.  I also feel that this tool has weaknesses in focus, and by default is a big set of reports that doesn't immediately seem valuable. Don't get me wrong I feel this is a great tool but for ecommerce for example you have to highly customize your installation and generate custom reports to really find actionable data. As far as general site usage and reporting it has tons of relevant and very interesting information as well as a ton of documentation and community support plus its [FREE](http://google.com/analytics "Free website analytics software from Google") so definitely a better choice than the visitor graph on your web hosts admin panel.

#### 2\. Yahoo! Web Analytics

This great tool was previously known as indextools until its [purchase](http://visualrevenue.com/blog/2008/04/yahoo-acquires-web-analytics-company.html "Yahoo! purchase indextools") by Yahoo! This is a very powerful enterprise level analytics software. It is highly targeted for conversion based metrics and is a beautiful compliment to their ecommerce and advertising platforms. This software features fully customizable dashboards for reporting convenience, powerful ad-hoc scenarios for specific data extraction, and drill down options for even greater flexibility in reporting. I find this to be an invaluable tool for Yahoo stores and highly promote its usage to their customers. One limitation in fact is it is now fairly restricted to their customer base so it is not a free option for all site owners. I work in this daily with clients so I naturally will be writing several articles in this series that highlight features and options within this software for those ecommerce site administrators and owners on the Yahoo! platform that need to make sense of this expansive tool set.

#### 3\. Piwik

[_http://piwik.org/_](http://piwik.org/)

This is a fantastic open source project that aims to compete with Google Analytics. This option unlike the others is self-hosted. So if you or your client has issues with data being disclosed to Google or another major entity then this may be the right solution for your next project. This option is a quick install similar to a content management system. It is powered with php and mysql and utilizes javascript like the others to gather visitor details and report them data back to the software. This is a bit more for the techie group as the database and application are self hosted so therefore are also self maintained. I ran this on Yahoo! shared web hosting with relative ease but in a large traffic environment more powerful dedicated hosting may be needed. I like the flexibility of this software in that custom widgets can be created and added via iframes and it has a highly versatile API for even larger projects and capabilities. I typically recommend this software for the developers that are reluctant to use anlytics due to data privacy but still need a robust analytics option for site analysis.

### Conclusion :

When I advise clients on how to approach web analytics I always advise to **_think of the questions you want answered_** about your sites performance before accessing the reports. Data is just data and the key is to focus on what you are trying to accomplish with your content and what types of data would be helpful to show success and areas of opportunity.

The next steps are installation and setting up clear goals for our software to track. Review the above options and in the next post we will begin configuring them to track our sites effectively so we can gain more success online.
