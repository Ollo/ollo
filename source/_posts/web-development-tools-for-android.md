It's been almost two years since I got my first Android phone, a simple HTC Hero on sprint and over time I finally have found a comfortable balance between flair and functionality. My phone is literally a second computer for me so naturally I have configured it in a way that allows room for some basic tools for web development. This post is going to outline some of these tools and how they benefit me in my workflow and assist in being productive even on the go.

#### Hardware

First things first lets chat quickly about hardware. I bought my hero right before the release of some beefier 4g handsets and at first felt a bit behind the curve. This all changed when I started to run into space issues and tons of lag. The fix? Root It!! I used the guidance of some friends and a great community / forum to supply the details and needed pieces but its the best thing I could have done. I'm a big fan of open source and rooting has provided a closer adherence to this preference and drastically improved the flexibility and performance of my phone. I lost the warranty but when your almost 2 years into a contract who cares the carrier is only going to push an upgrade anyway. Now I have a much faster phone with no restrictions and NO worthless Nascar apps :) I'd strongly suggest rooting if your having performance issues and want to extend the life of an older handset.

#### Tools

##### ES File Explorer

The first tool I have found ever so useful is the [](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop&hl=en "ES File Explorer") This is the best file manager and explorer I have found. It provides solid performance and the ability to locate any file on my device or sd card. It also has integration for ftp and cloud servers so I can access my live files if I need to make a quick edit or jump into my dropbox to upload a file to the server or vice versa. Definitely a big efficiency booster as I don't have to go mucking around looking for my content or files.

##### Silver Edit

I only use the lite version of this app since I don't typically need to do large amounts of code manipulation while on a handset with a 3 inch screen but having a code editor that handles, html, css, javascript, php , xml and just about anything else I could need is super helpful. It has a very clean UI and is very simple to use and get started with. I primarily work on a mac with textmate when I code but saving something to drop box and having it on a train ride to review and make minor changes to is super helpful. Combine this with the ftp functionality of ES and you can even make bug fixes on the go. Definitely a recommend. [Full specs here ](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.silver.edit)

##### Dropbox

Dropbox is a free cloud service for file hosting. I use it for my current projects as I can have access to them from any location where I have the service installed { which is all of my computers ;p }. When you sign up they provide a basic free plan of 2gb which for my most current projects is more than ample. Having access to these project files is a big part of my workflow so having a great android app to access them is a great bonus. Not the most mandatory tool but having access to these files on the go via the app and through the ES file explorer for quick copies and updates just makes things easier for me.

##### PDAnet

This is an app I have blogged about before but it continues to be a standby in my toolbox. It's a simple application for using your mobile for usb tethering your internet connection to a laptop. I've found the need to always carry my macbook with me and due to using a local host I typically don't need an internet connection to test my work and develop on the go. Having a stand by when your really need to check the codex for a WordPress function or check the docs for Jquery is super helpful so I always have this installed just in case.

##### Mobile Google Analytics

Ok so last one and yes I also have talked about this app before as well but if your going to work on your site on the go and be a true webmaster I feel monitoring its performance goes hand in hand. If you don't monitor user behavior and track how your content is being used then whats the point. This has frequently given me insight as to a new referral or a page or post that is causing issues { 404's }. I stress the use of analytics on all websites even if its not for ecommerce because I strongly feel this is the only way to provide the intended user experience. Take it or leave it but I'd strongly recommend some basic analysis as part of your mobile environment.

#### Conclusion

So whether your a coder or an analyst or just a nerdy android user these tools will hopefully be beneficial in up-ing some productivity in between games of angry birds. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions on rooting and I'd be happy to send some links and offer any guidance I can.
